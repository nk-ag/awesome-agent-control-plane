> A curated list of tools, frameworks, and resources for building and securing the **AI agent control plane** — the layer that decides what an autonomous agent is allowed to do, before it does it.

AI agents don't just generate text anymore — they call tools, run shell commands, hit APIs, read and write files, and talk to other agents. The control plane is everything that governs that behavior: identity for agents, policy enforcement at the point of action, gateways that mediate traffic, sandboxes that contain the blast radius, and the audit trail that proves what happened.

This list is organized around that lifecycle rather than around any single vendor or protocol.
